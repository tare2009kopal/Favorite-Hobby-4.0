        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I have been swimming since I was 3 years old. At the age of 7, I joined a swim team called San Ramon Valley Aquatics (SRVA swimming). I began competing against other teams in my state, and at the age of 10, I joined another swim team called Pleasanton Seahawks, a gold medal swim team. There, I practice 5 days a week for 1.5 hours each day, Monday through Friday. Now I am working to qualify for bigger competitions such as the Junior Olympics, or Far Western. That's why swimming is my favorite hobby.</p>

            Michael Phelps is one of the best swimmers of all time. He is on the American National Swim Team and has won 23 gold medals, 3 silver medals, and two bronze medals in the Olympics alone!! He is the youngest competitor to ever swim at the olympics. When he first competed in the olympics, he was only 15 years old, which is the youngest age anyone has ever competed at the olympics for over 64 years! In fact, at the end of the 2008 Olympics, Micael Phelps helpd over 7 world records!!! Michael Phelps is truly a very competitive swimmer, and will be hard to defeat in the future
